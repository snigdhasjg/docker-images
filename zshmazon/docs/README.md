## How to Use ZSHmazon

### Run the ZSHmazon Docker Sandbox:
- To run the Docker image with the previously created volume mounted to `/home/sandbox` for the user `sandbox`, use the following command:
```shell
docker run --name sandbox -v zshmazon-sandbox:/home/sandbox --rm -it macabrequinox/zshmazon
```
- Along with running the container, this command creates a docker volume named `zshmazon-sandbox`.
- This command starts the ZSHmazon Docker container, providing you with a secure and permission-free environment to run commands and experiment.
- Once you exit, it automatically deletes the container instance.

Now you're ready to enjoy your ZSHmazon Docker Sandbox, where you can safely execute commands without worrying about permissions or security issues. 
Feel free to customize your environment and configurations within the sandbox, and any changes on home directory will be stored in the `zshmazon-sandbox` volume for future use.

### To Have a Fresh Start Again:
- reset all settings just delete the `ZSHmazon-sandbox` volume by running the following command:
```shell
docker volume rm zshmazon-sandbox
```
- This volume was storing your configuration and setups of docker image's home directory.
